# Network Automation Labs

This repository contains hands-on network automation labs focused on applying Python to common network operations tasks. The projects emphasize practical workflows, secure remote access, and repeatable automation rather than manual device management.

Labs are built using **GNS3** with Cisco IOS devices and a cloud node deployed on the **GNS3 VM running on VMware Workstation Pro**, as the local PC server was insufficient for reliable operation. Automation is executed from a **Windows 11 host** using SSH.

## Focus Areas

* Network automation fundamentals
* Cisco routing and switching environments
* Secure remote device access
* Python scripting for operational tasks
* Troubleshooting and validation of automation workflows

## Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Netmiko
* Cisco IOS
* GNS3 (VM on VMware Workstation Pro)
* Windows OpenSSH

## Repository Structure

Each lab is documented with:

* Source code
* Supporting documentation
* Selected screenshots showing setup and results

This repository is intended to demonstrate practical, entry-level network automation skills and can be expanded with additional labs and multi-device workflows over time.
