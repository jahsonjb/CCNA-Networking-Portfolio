# 🧰 CCNA Lab Portfolio – Built in GNS3 & Cisco Packet Tracer

Welcome! I’m **Jahson Jno-Baptiste (JB)** — an IT professional and veteran, building my way into **network engineering & cybersecurity** through hands-on labs.  

This repository is my **hands-on CCNA portfolio**, showcasing:  
- Configuration skills (switching, routing, security)  
- Troubleshooting ability (broken → fixed labs)  
- Documentation habits (configs, screenshots, markdown)  
- Network design (home labs with pfSense, VMware, and Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 🔹 Lab Categories

### 🔸 Switching Labs
- [VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing](./switching-labs/vlan-intervlan/)  
  Configure VLANs, router-on-a-stick, and troubleshoot common issues.  

### 🔸 Routing Labs
- [Static & Dynamic Routing (OSPF focus)](./routing-labs/static-vs-ospf/)
  Showcases subnetting, route advertisement, and path selection.  

### 🔸 Security Labs
- [ACLs](./security-labs/acls/) – Traffic filtering and access control.  
- [NAT/PAT](./security-labs/nat-pat/) – IP translation for WAN/Internet access.  

### 🔸 Troubleshooting Scenarios
- [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting-scenarios/)
- Intentionally broken labs to demonstrate **diagnosis + repair process**.  

### 🔸 Network Designs
- [Enterprise Network Labs](./network-designs/)  
  Realistic design with segmentation, DHCP/DNS, and firewall zones.

## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated

✔ VLAN segmentation & trunking  
✔ Router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing  
✔ Static & dynamic routing (OSPF)  
✔ ACLs (standard & extended)  
✔ NAT & PAT configuration  
✔ Systematic troubleshooting (ping, traceroute, show/debug)  
✔ Network documentation (configs, diagrams, markdown notes)  
✔ Firewall + home lab design with pfSense

## 🎯 Why This Portfolio Matters

Employers don’t just want certifications — they want proof of **real-world, hands-on capability**.  
This repo shows:

- **Configuration fluency** (raw configs + guides)  
- **Troubleshooting process** (broken/fixed labs)  
- **Documentation habits** (markdown + screenshots)  
- **Initiative**: building labs without physical routers/switches  

📌 *Built with GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer, VMware, VPCS, pfSense, and open-source tools.*

## ✍️ Beyond GitHub

Each lab will also be published as a **Medium article** (300–600 words) with:  
- What the challenge was  
- How I solved it  
- Screenshots & configs  
- Reflection on what I learned
