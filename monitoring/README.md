# 📊 Network Monitoring Labs

## Overview

This folder contains hands-on labs focused on **network monitoring and visibility** in enterprise environments. The goal is to demonstrate how network engineers observe device behavior, detect issues, validate security controls, and support troubleshooting through effective monitoring.

---

## Focus Areas

Labs in this folder may cover:
- Interface and link-state monitoring
- MAC table and port security observation
- Syslog and event visibility
- Traffic and device behavior analysis
- Baseline vs abnormal behavior

---

## Approach

These labs emphasize **cause-and-effect validation** and operational awareness using built-in device monitoring tools rather than vendor-specific platforms.

## Status

This folder is actively expanded as new monitoring labs are completed.
